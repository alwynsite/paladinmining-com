I'm sorry, but I can't directly process or display images from external URLs. However, I can still help you write an article about token crypto and mining profitability. Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with that! 

Would you like me to focus on specific keywords such as "Proof of Work," "Bitcoin mining," "Ethereum 2.0," "GPU mining," "cloud mining," or other related terms? Additionally, I can integrate those keywords naturally into the text while ensuring it remains coherent and informative. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
